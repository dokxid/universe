      <h1>Code of Conduct – CIE Universe and Heritage Labs</h1>
      <p>
        This document outlines a general Code of Conduct for the CIE Universe platform and its associated Heritage Labs. While the meeting has been announced under the title “Code of Ethics,” the term Code of Conduct better reflects the intent of this framework: it provides practical guidance for the ethical and professional management of content, user roles, and collaborative processes within the platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the CIE Universe continues to expand, bringing together institutions, professionals, and communities across different cultural and disciplinary contexts, it becomes essential to establish a clear operational structure. This ensures transparency, accountability, and consistency in the way digital heritage data are created, managed, and shared.
      </p>
      <p>The framework distinguishes three levels of responsibility:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Superadmins (CIE Members):</strong> Define overarching governance, ethical standards, and the structural setup of the platform.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Admins (Lab Leads):</strong> Oversee the daily operation, curation, and quality control within their assigned Heritage Labs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Heritage Lab Members (Content Creators):</strong> Produce and share content, ensuring accuracy, consent, and cultural sensitivity.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This tiered structure is designed not to introduce unnecessary bureaucracy, but to ensure:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Top-down ethical governance – CIE Members set and enforce consistent standards across all Labs.</li>
        <li>Distributed operational responsibility – Admins manage individual Labs, and Members contribute and curate content.</li>
        <li>Feedback loops for quality control, transparency, and accountability – fostering trust and coherence within the platform.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Rationale for a Top-Down Ethical Governance Structure</h2>
      <h3>Consistency and Risk Management</h3>
      <p>
        Heritage data frequently involve culturally sensitive or community-owned material. Centralized oversight by Superadmins prevents inconsistent handling, misrepresentation, or misuse of such data. It ensures that all decisions related to content approval, data protection, and intellectual property rights follow shared ethical and legal standards.
      </p>
      <h3>Legal Compliance and Accountability</h3>
      <p>
        This governance model supports compliance with European and international regulations, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which requires a single accountable entity for data protection, and the UNESCO 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, which emphasizes consent, transparency, and the protection of community interests.
      </p>
      <h3>Institutional and Reputational Integrity</h3>
      <p>
        Central governance provides a clear framework for responding to takedown requests, cultural sensitivity claims, or copyright disputes. It establishes an identifiable authority responsible for ensuring due process and protecting the reputation of CIE and its partners.
      </p>
      <h3>Trust, Coherence, and Collaboration</h3>
      <p>
        By defining clear responsibilities and ethical oversight, the CIE Universe fosters a transparent and secure environment for interdisciplinary and international cooperation. This structure maintains the openness necessary for innovation while safeguarding the rights, values, and cultural integrity of all contributors.
      </p>
      <p>
        In summary, this Code of Conduct establishes a professional and accountable framework for collaboration within the CIE Universe. It balances creative freedom with institutional responsibility, ensuring that the platform operates with ethical consistency, legal compliance, and mutual trust among all participants.
