        description:
            "Jaffa was the most advanced, vibrant, prosperous and wealthy city in Palestine. It produced Jaffa oranges, colored floor tiles, handmade carpets, textiles and tobacco. The port city was a commercial hub boasting an array of successful businesses, with banking, fishing, and agriculture industries. When it came to intellect, Jaffa was the center for culture, literature, media and publishing in Palestine. This went with cafes to read these papers and discuss new ideas, restaurants for debate and political new thinking. Jaffa had modern cinemas and theaters which hosted international top-notch artists, singers and performers. In the thirties, a common view was having  45 ships in its harbor waiting to be uploaded, in addition to hundreds of boats. In Arabic, Jaffa is called ‘Bride Of The Sea’. After Jaffans developed a global product, the Shammouti or the Jaffa Orange the city saw a financial boom which contributed to modern urbanism. One of the first designs for a Palestinian flag had a Jaffa orange in its middle. Jaffa is also called ‘Lady of Oranges’, more about Jaffa oranges a little later.\nJaffa’s archaeology goes back to the late stone age and it was continuously inhabited from the Bronze Age until 1948. It was built on a 40m high hill where the wind from the west is its air conditioner. The city is lush, lying near two rivers and multiple water sources. With a natural harbor, Jaffa was the primary port of Canaan and the point of connection between Asia, Africa and Europe. With its closest neighbors, Beirut, Damascus and Cairo, Jaffa had strong shared businesses, intermarriage, music, cuisine, culture and history.  Jaffa was also one of the endpoints of the Silk Road from the far east, and the place for Europeans to get acquainted with, and purchase spices, silks, glass, soap, recipes, ideas and religion.\nJaffa had long been connected to Europe, at least since the Philistines arrived at its shores in the 12th century BC. However, Europe had been arriving intensely at its port, sleeping in its rooms, renting its donkeys, eating in its taverns, paying its guides and translators since about 400 AD when Christian pilgrims started arriving in “The Holy Land”. Venice had special ties with Jaffa, as it had a lucrative business of  ‘all-inclusive’ pilgrimage trips arriving in the city’s port. Jaffa has seen Europe’s poor, sick, sinful, monks, nuns, priests, knights, merchants, lords, princes, princesses, kings and queens from all over the continent. Naturally, it was called ‘Port of Jerusalem’ and ‘Mother of Strangers’.\nAs an ancient Mediterranean port city, Jaffa did not bow down to occupiers. Jaffa’s culture of resistance dates back to the time of the Pharaohs when it was a Canaanite town, this archeological evidence is clear. Palestine had a long stream of occupiers including the Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Muslims, Crusaders, Mamluks, Ottomans and the British. And Jaffa prospered as a capital in Palestine during the Islamic period when Palestine lived a Golden Age between the 8th and 10th centuries. But in June 1100, the Doge himself with 200 ships and about 9000 Venetians arrived in Jaffa to take over. The Crusaders sought religious purity and achieved that in a very bloody manner. Although most Palestinians at that time were Christians, to the Crusaders, indigenous Palestinians, regardless of religion, were unwanted. Venice got the right to build a church and a marketplace in every city that the Crusaders conquered. Jaffa was an important center for trade. Fortunately, the Crusaders were defeated by Saladin in the Battle of Jaffa in 1192 (after they were defeated earlier in north Palestine). In 1799 after sieging Jaffa for 3 days, Napoleon massacred about 4000 people – the inhabitants were all Arabs, children and adults. With the city sparking interest for settlers from around the world, Jaffans have learned to look out for anything arriving from the West.\nIn the 19th century, Jaffa became an important center of Arab nationalism and resistance. In 1834, The Peasant Revolt was suppressed by the Egyptian ruler Muhammad Ali Basha. This revolt reduced the male population of Palestine by about one-fifth. In 1916, Jaffa was again at the core of the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire. It didn’t take long for the occupiers to change once more, and the Jaffans revolted against the British in 1936. The British blew up 240 buildings, a significant chunk of the old city, to punish the Jaffans. This collective and architectural urban punishment left a strong mark on the city. Yet, about eleven years later, Jaffa was still a city with 14 public hammams (bath houses), 13 mosques, 6 churches, about 30 cafes, five hospitals, 18 schools, 15 headquarters of newspapers and magazines and their publishers and selling points and printing houses, 7 big markets, 18 cinemas, theaters, banks, railway station, ships, boats, busses, trains, cars, storages, orange orchards – their owners and workers would resist, as always, but on May 13 in 1948 Jaffa falls and its inhabitants disappear.",

            "Often described as frozen in time, Island of Mozambique is a cultural melting-pot. Its inhabitants have learned how to constantly adapt to new external factors – either the arrival of a new political force or the challenges of climate change. The Island’s urban planning has a pronounced architectural division at its centre, dated from the 19th century.  Connected to mainland Mozambique with a bridge on its southern end, the streets become progressively less crowded as we cross the Island into Stone City (Cidade de Pedra), on its opposite end. Even though most attention goes to the latter, the majority of local’s daily routines take place in the Macuti part of the Island. The markets, main mosque, and fishing activities are all located in this area, despite the difference in infrastructure, and the sewage system.  \n\nIsland of Mozambique has caught the attention of several peoples, throughout the years, all leaving part of their heritage, knowledge systems, traditions. Mozambique’s history can be traced back to around the year 200 CE with the progressive occupation of the territory by the Bantu people. It is said that it is where the majority of today’s population descends from. Accounts from the Persian and Arab world report that in the 1st millennia international trade was taking place from the port of Sofala, south of the Island of Mozambique. The Island has strong swahili, arab, portuguese, indian influences, all a direct reflection of its endurance through time.\n\nIt was viewed as a strategic commerical outpost in the Indian Ocean, inserted in the maritime trade with India, later expanded to Europe and to the Americas. Until the XIX the Island was deeply connected with the slave trade, a legacy that still has its imprints.\n\nIn 1818, Island of Mozambique was elevated to a city, a date celebrated locally today. Nevertheless, its importance continued to decay and in 1898 the Island lost its capital status to Lourenço Marques in south Mozambique, today called Maputo.\n\nToday the Island is celebrated as a site of tolerance, where several faiths and peoples can co-exist in peace.\n\nThe Island of Mozambique was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1991, one year before the end of the civil war. It was a joint effort of the Island’s inhabitants, civic movements, and archaeologists at a local and national level that eventually led to its nomination.\n\nThe spotlight on the value of Island of Mozambique is given to the Portuguese presence on its territory, the maritime trading routes, and the architecture present on the Island. This platform’s goal is to add new layers to the main narrative that it is told about Island of Mozambique. Which stories are untold? What does the local community has to say about their city, their streets, their traditions? ",

Evidence of the first prehistorical settlements in the region have been documented through the numerous mesolithic, neolithic, and megalithic sites found throughout the state. The first recorded mentions of Kerala come much later, in the 3rd century BCE, when the region was governed by the Chera dynasty.",
