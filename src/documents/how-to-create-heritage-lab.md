Interested institutions and individuals are invited to establish their own Heritage Lab within the CIE Universe in the future. The technical infrastructure and onboarding workflows for this process are currently being finalised. During this interim phase, the first step towards founding a new Heritage Lab is to send an email to Robert Parthesius with a brief description of the planned lab’s objectives, its location, and the people or organisations involved. Based on this initial information, the proposal can be discussed further and aligned with the overarching framework of the CIE Universe and its Heritage Labs. As soon as the technical setup is complete, the process for starting a new Heritage Lab will be streamlined and supported by dedicated online tools and documentation.
